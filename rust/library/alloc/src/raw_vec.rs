/// A low-level utility for more ergonomically allocating, reallocating, and deallocating
/// a buffer of memory on the heap without having to worry about all the corner cases
/// involved. This type is excellent for building your own data structures like Vec and VecDeque.
/// In particular:
///
/// * Produces `Unique::dangling()` on zero-sized types.
/// * Produces `Unique::dangling()` on zero-length allocations.
/// * Avoids freeing `Unique::dangling()`.
/// * Catches all overflows in capacity computations (promotes them to "capacity overflow" panics).
/// * Guards against 32-bit systems allocating more than isize::MAX bytes.
/// * Guards against overflowing your length.
/// * Calls `handle_alloc_error` for fallible allocations.
/// * Contains a `ptr::Unique` and thus endows the user with all related benefits.
/// * Uses the excess returned from the allocator to use the largest available capacity.
///
/// This type does not in anyway inspect the memory that it manages. When dropped it *will*
/// free its memory, but it *won't* try to drop its contents. It is up to the user of `RawVec`
/// to handle the actual things *stored* inside of a `RawVec`.
///
/// Note that the excess of a zero-sized types is always infinite, so `capacity()` always returns
/// `usize::MAX`. This means that you need to be careful when round-tripping this type with a
/// `Box<[T]>`, since `capacity()` won't yield the length.
