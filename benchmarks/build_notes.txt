Some benchmarks like tokio, hyper, base64 have many dependencies that won't run because the TRust compiler is
of a very old version.
Run: cargo update -Z minimal-versions
But be careful as this command will reset some dependencies to version too old to build and those need to be fixed by hand by writing the exact extension.

Run:
env RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUSTFLAGS="-C codegen-units=1 -C save-temps -Zprint-link-args --emit=llvm-bc -C metasafe -C trust -Clink-args=-Wl,-rpath=/home/martin/projects/metasafe/trust/mpk-mimalloc/out/release -L/home/martin/projects/metasafe/trust/mpk-mimalloc/out/release -lmimalloc -Clink-args=-Wl,-rpath=/home/martin/projects/metasafe/trust/mpk-library/rust-lib/target/release -L/home/martin/projects/metasafe/trust/mpk-library/rust-lib/target/release -lrustfuncs" cargo bench --no-run  --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
